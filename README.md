#  Panic Attack Analysis – Power BI Reports

## Project Overview
This Power BI project dives into  focusing on understanding **panic attacks** through data.  
By visualizing triggers, demographics, and lifestyle patterns, this Reports helps uncover the **hidden correlations between stress, habits, and emotional well-being**.

The goal is to turn raw behavioral and psychological data into **actionable insights** that promote awareness.

##  Objectives
- Identify **high-risk groups** based on demographics and lifestyle factors  
- Analyze **frequency and severity trends** of panic attacks  
- Detect **common triggers** such as stress, sleep deprivation, or caffeine intake  
- Correlate **lifestyle choices** (sleep, caffeine) with panic attack recurrence

##  Reports Highlights
| Section | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Overview Page** | Summary of total cases, average frequency, and overall recovery rate |
| **Demographics View** | Breakdown by age, gender |
| **Trigger Analysis** | Visual identification of top panic triggers |
| **Time Trends** | weekly variations in panic episodes |
| **Lifestyle Correlation** | Relationship between habits (Social Anxiety, PTSD, Phobia, Stress, caffeine, sleep) and attack frequency |

##  Key Insights
- The **25–64 age group** reported the highest rate of panic attacks, often linked to  irregular sleep.    
- **Alcohol and sleep** correlated with panic severity.  
- **Number of Patient Symtoms**  were strong contributing triggers.

##  Tools & Techniques
- **Snow Flake ❄️** as source conncted to **Power BI Desktop**
- **Power Query** – Data cleaning and preprocessing, Custom coloumns for categorized values based on the panic score, using IF conditional formatting  
- **DAX** – Custom measures **Percentage of patients Dizziness**, **Age Group IF**, **Age Group Switch**
- **Visuals Used:** Cards, Stacked Bar Charts, Bar Cluster Charts, Line Charts, and Slicers
